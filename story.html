                <p class="text-center">The story is set in Tokyo, where an old school right in between the neighborhoods of <br>
                    Akihabara, Kanda and Jinbocho is in danger of consolidation and closure. <br><br>
                    Nine girls, centering Honoka Kosaka, have stepped up <br>
                    to defy the imminent danger facing their school. <br><br>

                    we need to become idols!” <br>
                    Hoping against hope there’s something they can do about this, <br>
                    the girls strive to become famous, <br>
                    spread the word about their school, attract more students, and save the day. <br><br>
                    Now their “School Idol Project” begins to make their dreams come true! <br>
                    “Make our dreams come true!” <br></p>
